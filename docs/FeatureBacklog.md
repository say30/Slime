# Feature Backlog & Stretch Ideas

The following ideas extend the current prototype and ensure the experience remains challenging and rewarding.

## Immediate Next Steps
- **Personal Preview Spawners:** Spawn client-only slime holograms for each preview entry and display stat cards before purchase confirmation.
- **Pod Placement Prompts:** Attach ProximityPrompts to each `PodSlot` attachment. Prompt should support placing slimes from inventory, retrieving to inventory, and quick-sell actions.
- **Datastore Integration:** Persist wallet balances, inventory contents, base level, pod assignments, and contract progress across sessions.
- **Slimedex UI:** Build a paginated UI that visualizes the 3,600 combinations. Highlight collected variants and grey-out missing entries. Provide hints when a state is discovered for the first time.
- **Shopfront UI:** Present catalyst stock levels, preview timers, and purchase buttons alongside the player's gelatin and essence balances.

## Economy Enhancements
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Increase slime costs when a player purchases multiple slimes of the same mood in a short window to encourage diversification.
- **Seasonal Catalysts:** Rotate limited catalysts weekly. Some catalysts could guarantee specific fusion states when combined with high rarity inputs.
- **Guild Contracts:** Introduce cooperative contracts that require contributions from multiple players, distributing essence and unique cosmetics as rewards.

## Base & World Upgrades
- **Base Level 2 & 3 Visuals:** Swap meshes or add decorative modules when a base upgrades to reflect progression visually.
- **Module Rooms:** Allow players to spend essence to add functional rooms (fusion lab, catalyst refinery) that provide passive bonuses or unique interactions.
- **Defense Events:** Periodically spawn hostile creatures that attempt to sabotage pods. Players must defend to protect their slimes, rewarding essence when successful.

## Live Ops Hooks
- **Daily Login Bonus:** Reward small amounts of gelatin and essence with streak multipliers.
- **Time-Limited Events:** Introduce event-exclusive moods/states with bespoke fusion recipes to keep collectors engaged.
- **Analytics Hooks:** Instrument purchase, fusion, and contract events to balance the economy with live data.

These items ensure each system supports the others, keeping the progression curve steep without feeling unfair.
